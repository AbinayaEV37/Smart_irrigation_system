# Smart_irrigation_system
Smart Irrigation System for Precision Farming

# Proposed Solution:
• Temperature and Moisture sensor is used to measure the parameters of the field environment.
• The values of the sensors is updated in the Firebase and web application.
• Plant type and Soil type is taken as input from farmer.
• The data from the farmer and the sensor values will be integrated , based on that the water level for the field will be decided.
• If the water level is low the motor is turned ON else OFF .This water level varies for the different plants.
• The mobile application is provided using Blynk Application.
• The sensors are strategically placed in different parts of an agricultural field and will provide a precise irrigation solution based on the needs of each section of the field. 

# System Components:
Hardware: Soil moisture, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, ESP8266, relays, pumps.
Software: Firebase, Blynk IOT
Mobile App: Blynk app and Web Application

# Technical Feasibility:
- Sensors are affordable, reliable, and widely available.
- Optimizing water usage reduces costs and conserves water for farmers.#
# Potential Challenges:
- Initial investment may be a barrier for farmers.
- Farmers may lack the technical knowledge to operate and maintain systems.
# Strategies to Overcome Challenges:
- Develop a user-friendly mobile application.
- Provide early training and support in the regional language.

# Impact:
• Lower water and energy bills with fewer manual interventions.
• Healthier plants lead to better yields and quality.
• Uses sensors to reduce water waste, optimizing water usage.

# Benefits:
• Enhances crop yields, ensuring a stable food supply.
• For Healthier Ecosystems it Maintains balanced soil moisture and supports biodiversity, improving overall ecosystem health.
